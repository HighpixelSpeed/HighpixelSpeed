Hypixel Says AUTOMATIC REQUEUE MOD:

Instructions:

Download the hypixelsays-1.0.jar file from the github
Put this in the mods folder (which can be accessed by doing %appdata% in search, then opening .minecraft and mods)
Launch minecraft with forge 1.8.9

Commands:
/hs: This enables and disables the mod.  Must be done in a lobby 
/hs lag: This enables lag compatability if the server is lagging or you have high ping/bad connection

Usage:
First enable the mod in a lobby using /hs
Join a hypixel says game - the mod should print Joined Hypixel Says, if it prints Not Hypixel Says then you need to requeue.
This happens rarely and is due to lag (if this happens more than once you should do /hs lag to enable lag mode)

Do not disable/enable/restart the mod in game.  This will make the mod not function for that round
If you did everything correctly, just play normally and the mod will requeue when you have a 100% chance of winning

Good Luck!
