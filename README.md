# Hypixel Says AUTOMATIC REQUEUE MOD:

### Instructions:
Download the latest release file from the github.
Put this in the mods folder (which can be accessed by doing `%appdata%` in search, then opening `.minecraft` and `mods`).
Launch minecraft with forge 1.8.9.

### Commands:
`/hs`: This enables and disables the mod. This must be done in a lobby.

`/hs forty`: This enables requeuing if you cannot get a 40-point game.

`/hs help`: This shows a summary of these commands.

`/hs lag`: This enables lag compatability if the server is lagging or you have high ping/bad connection.

`/hs loss`: This enables requeuing if you cannot get enough points and are guaranteed to lose the game.

`/hs play`: This is a shortcut to joining Hypixel Says.

### Usage:
First enable the mod in a lobby using `/hs`.
Join a hypixel says game - the mod should print Joined Hypixel Says, if it prints Not Hypixel Says, then you need to requeue.
This happens rarely and is due to lag (if this happens more than once you should do /hs lag to enable lag mode).

Do not disable/enable/restart the mod in game.
This will make the mod not function for that round.
If you did everything correctly, just play normally and the mod will requeue when you have a 100% chance of winning.

Good Luck!
