# Hypixel Says AUTOMATIC REQUEUE MOD:

### Instructions:
Download the latest release file from the github.
Put this in the mods folder (which can be accessed by doing `%appdata%` in search, then opening `.minecraft` and `mods`).
Launch minecraft with forge 1.8.9.

### Commands:
`/hs` This enables and disables the mod. This must be done in a lobby.  
`/hs forty` This disables requeuing if you can get a 40-point game.  
`/hs fortyonly` This enables requeuing if you cannot get a 40-point game.  
`/hs help` This shows a summary of these commands.  
`/hs loss` This enables requeuing if you cannot get enough points and are guaranteed to lose the game.  
`/hs play` This is a shortcut to joining Hypixel Says.

### Usage:
First enable the mod in a lobby using `/hs`.
Join a hypixel says game; the mod should print Joined Hypixel Says.
If you did everything correctly, just play normally and the mod will requeue when you have a 100% chance of winning.

Good Luck!
